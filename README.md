# Machine-Learning-Group-Project
final group project for Machine Learning at TX State

For this project, our group created four different machine-learning based classifiers (Support Vector Machines, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, 
and K-Nearest Neighbors) to predict the performance of students based on a variety of parameters. This project was based off a previous study shown here:

I was responsible for the Support Vector Machines portion and was team leader. Our results are summarized in "Final Machine Learning Project_group6.pdf."
This project was a tremendous success. Our group functioned and communicated efficiently, overcame several obstacles in the coding process, and we had an excellent presentation
largely thanks to our decision to rehearse beforehand.
